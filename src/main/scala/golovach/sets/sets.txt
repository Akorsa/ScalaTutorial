0. Category Theory + Set Theory = Basic of Math / Computer Science

1. Def
    Set - is unordered collection of distinct objects
    considered as an object in its own right

    Ex: {1,2,3}

    {1,2,3} = {3,2,1}

    Empty Set = {}

2. Ways to define a set :
    2.1 Using enumeration of all values (extensional definition)
        val set = Set(1,2,3,4) // for this definition we can use collections

    2.2 Predicative definition (intensional definition)
        predicate on some concrete set(Int, String ,Color)
        def p(x:Int):Boolean = _ > 0
        val p: Int => Boolean = _ > 10

        predicate on universal set(Any, AnyRef, AnyVal,...)
        def p(x:Any):Boolean = ???
        val p: Any => Boolean = ???

    2.3 Generative definition
        val set:Iterator[Int] = ???
        val stream:Stream[Int] = ???
